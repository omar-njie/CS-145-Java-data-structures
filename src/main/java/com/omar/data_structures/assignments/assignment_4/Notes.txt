CARD GAME:
    - Every card has 3 values expresses as Integers
        - (int R, int S, int P) {}
            - Each: low: 1, max: 1000.
        - Cards have a calculated cost of how far apart the R, S, P values are from on another.
            - Example: x -> sum: of R, P and S; x = R + P + S
            - Cost Formula: cost = [12/10 * ((R/S)^5 + (P/X)^5 + S/X)^5]
                - Round up to the nearest integer.
            - When comparing two cards: Higher cost comes after the other unless they have the same cost
                - if two cards have the same cost { (Card(R) == Card(S)) }
